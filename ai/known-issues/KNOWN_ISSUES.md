## Open Issues

### [DOC-001] Duplicate docs — git worktree lives inside the repo

**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open

**Description**: `.claude/worktrees/updatedocs-to-english/` is a git worktree checked out
**inside** the repo. It holds a second full copy of `ai/` and `docs/` — 88 duplicate `.md`
files against 118 real ones. The copy is stale (its `ai/skills/*.md` are still the empty
0-byte versions).

**Impact**: grep, file search and AI context all return two versions of every file. An agent
can silently read the outdated copy. Its `.git` file also holds an absolute Windows path, so
git run from any other environment fails with `fatal: not a git repository`.

**Fix Plan**:
```
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/updatedocs-to-english
git worktree add ../Real-updatedocs updatedocs-to-english
```
Worktrees must live **outside** the repo — see `ai/rules/multi-agent-workflow.md` §5.

### [DOC-002] Third copy of the repo left in OneDrive

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open

**Description**: The repo was moved to `D:\PersonalProject\Real`, but OneDrive re-synced a
partial copy back to `C:\Users\nhata\OneDrive\Máy tính\Real` (`ai/`, `docs/`, `.git`,
AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md).

**Fix Plan**: delete the OneDrive copy. Never keep the repo inside OneDrive — see
`docs/shared/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`.

### [DOC-003] `root-design-fe.md` is the token source but still marked draft

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open

**Description**: `docs/front-end-design-docs/root-design-fe.md` has `status: draft`, yet every
page spec and `specs/_DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` derive their tokens from it. It has also never been
rendered in a real page.

**Fix Plan**: promote to `status: active` once `/admin/users` is built and the tokens are
confirmed on screen.

---

### [DOC-004] HSK level range inconsistent across docs

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open

**Description**: `ai/context/project-brain.md` says HSK **1–9** (updated 2026-08-11, calling
1–6 a mistaken revert). Some other sources still say 1–6. `ENTITY_USER.md` has
`hskLevelGoal` documented as 1–9.

**Fix Plan**: sweep all docs, settle on 1–9, note it in an ADR.

---

### [API-001] Missing endpoints blocking the Admin UI

**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open

**Description**: Mapping the Admin surface surfaced endpoints that do not exist in
`docs/api/API_ADMIN.md`, the worst being `GET /api/v1/admin/payroll/:id`.
Also, the entire `INVOICE_*` error-code family is absent from `API_ERROR_CODES.md`.

**Fix Plan**: full list in `ai/PROGRESS.md` → `## Needs from the other lane`.

---

### [WEB-001] Sticky table header overlaps the first row

**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Resolved (pattern to avoid)

**Description**: A card wrapping a table with `overflow-hidden` becomes the containing block
for `position: sticky`. A `thead` with `sticky top-[56px]` is then pushed 56px down **inside
the card**, covering row 1.

**Workaround**: drop `overflow-hidden` from the card so the `thead` sticks to the viewport.

**Note**: `next build` passed with this bug present. It was only caught by screenshotting the
page and looking at it — build success is not render correctness.

---

## Technical Debt

### [DEBT-001] No cross-DB transactions

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Won't Fix (by design)

**Description**: PostgreSQL and MongoDB do not share a transaction. If creating a Question (MongoDB) succeeds but linking it to an Assignment (PostgreSQL) fails, orphan data can result.

**Workaround**: Periodic cleanup script, or soft-delete instead of hard-delete.

---

### [DEBT-002] No real-time notifications (polling only)

**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Won't Fix (Sprint 6 scope)

**Description**: Notifications use 60-second polling, not real-time WebSocket.

**Workaround**: Polling interval is sufficient for the current use case.
